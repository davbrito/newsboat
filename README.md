Downloading
-----------

You can download the latest version of Newsboat from the official site:
https://newsboat.org/

Alternatively, you can check out the latest version from the Git repository:

	$ git clone git://github.com/newsboat/newsboat.git

Dependencies
------------

Newsboat depends on a number of libraries, which need to be installed before
Newsboat can be compiled.

<!--
    UPDATE doc/newsboat.asciidoc IF YOU CHANGE THIS LIST
-->
- GCC 4.9 or newer, or Clang 3.6 or newer
- Stable [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) and Cargo (Rust's package
    manager) (1.44.0 or newer; might work with older versions, but we don't
    check that)
- [STFL (version 0.21 or newer)](http://www.clifford.at/stfl/)
- [SQLite3 (version 3.5 or newer)](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html)
- [libcurl (version 7.21.6 or newer)](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html)
- Header files for the SSL library that libcurl uses. You can find out which
    library that is from the output of `curl --version`; most often that's
    OpenSSL, sometimes GnuTLS, or maybe something else.
- GNU gettext (on systems that don't provide gettext in the libc):
  ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gettext/
- [pkg-config](https://pkg-config.freedesktop.org/wiki/)
- [libxml2](http://xmlsoft.org/downloads.html)
- [json-c (version 0.11 or newer)](https://github.com/json-c/json-c/wiki)
- [Asciidoctor](https://asciidoctor.org/) (1.5.3 or newer)
- Some implementation of AWK like [GNU AWK](https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk) or [NAWK](https://github.com/onetrueawk/awk).

Developers will also need:

- [xtr (version 0.1.4 or newer)](https://github.com/woboq/tr) (can be installed
    with `cargo install xtr`)
- [Coco/R for C++](http://www.ssw.uni-linz.ac.at/coco/), needed to re-generate
    filter language parser using `regenerate-parser` target.

Installation
------------

<!--
    UPDATE doc/newsboat.asciidoc IF YOU CHANGE THIS LIST
-->

There are numerous ways:

- install from your distribution's repository ([a lot of distros have
    a package](https://repology.org/project/newsboat));

- install via [Snap](https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd):

      $ sudo snap install newsboat

- [build from source with Docker](doc/docker.md). Note that the resulting binary
    might not run outside of that same Docker container if your system doesn't
    have all the necessary libraries, or if their versions are too old;

- build from source in a chroot: to avoid polluting your system with developer
    packages, or to avoid upgrading, you might use a tool like
    [`debootstrap`](https://wiki.debian.org/Debootstrap) to create an isolated
    environment. Once that's done, just build from source as outlined in the
    next item;

- build from source.

    Install everything that's listed in the "Dependencies" section above. Make
    sure to install the header files as well (on Debian and derivatives, headers
    are in `-dev` packages, e.g. `libsqlite3-dev`.)

    Then compile and install with:

      $ make                   #  pass -jN to use N CPU cores, e.g. -j8
      $ sudo make install      #  install everything under /usr/local

    To install to a different directory, pass `prefix` like so: `sudo make
    prefix=/opt/newsboat install`.

    To uninstall, run `sudo make uninstall`.

Cross-compilers need to set `CARGO_BUILD_TARGET`; see [cargo
documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#environment-variables).

Development
-----------

Decided to work on an issue, fix a bug or add a feature? Great! Be sure to
check out [our style guide](doc/internal/code-style.markdown).

You'll probably want to run the tests; here's how:

	$ TMPDIR=/dev/shm make -j5 PROFILE=1 check

The "5" here is the number of CPU cores in your machine *plus one*. This
parallelises the build. Rust tests already utilize as many cores as they can,
but if you want to limit them, use the `RUST_TEST_THREADS` environment variable.
`/dev/shm` is a "ramdisk", i.e. a virtual disk stored in the RAM. The tests
create a lot of temporary files, and benefit from fast storage; a ramdisk is
even better than an SSD.

Newsboat can also be [built in Docker](doc/docker.md).
