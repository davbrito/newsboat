By default, Newsboat stores all the files in a traditional Unix fashion, i.e.
in the "dotdir" located at _~/.newsboat_. However, it also supports a modern
way,
https://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html[XDG Base Directory Specification],
which splits the files between the following locations:

- _~/.local/share/newsboat/_
- _~/.config/newsboat/_

If these directories exist or the environment variables `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and
`$XDG_DATA_HOME` are set, Newsboat will use these directories, otherwise it
will default to _~/.newsboat_ as its configuration directory.

If you're currently using _~/.newsboat/_ but wish to migrate to XDG
directories, you should move the files as follows:

_config_, _urls_::
        to _$HOME/.config/newsboat/_

_cache.db_, _history.search_, _history.cmdline_, _queue_::
        to _$HOME/.local/share/newsboat/_
